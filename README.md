The game has a human player named “Mariko” whose job is to collect all coins given in the grid, and also 5 enemy bots whose job is to find and kill the human player. If the player collects all the coins given in the grid it wins. The 5 enemy bots are powered by 5 different AI algorithms. If the human player is intercepted by any of the enemy bots, the game gets over. 
This game also demonstrates the optimality and time complexity of various path searching algorithms in a creative way, where one can easily visualize how different search algorithm affects the decision each agent make to decide which path to choose out of multiple possible paths.
The AI algorithms used are :A*,BFS,DFS,UCS.
